DISCOS
 - Best and worst case for selection are the same because no matter what, Java will make a swap
 - 
QCC
 - When the array already sorted for bubble sort, why don't we stop the loop once there are zero swaps for a pass?

BUB-QA
 - If a pass requires no swaps, what do you know?
    - The array is sorted.
 - After pass p, what do you know?
    - All values decreasing from index  p-1 (inclusive) are sorted.
 - How many passes are necessary to completely sort?
     - For an array of length n it needs n -1 passes. 
SEL-QA
 - How many passes to sort n elements?
    - n - 1 passes
 - What do you know after pass p?
    - After P passes the last P elements are permanent
 - How do you know if sorted?
    - after n passes where n is the length of the array
 - What does a pass boil down to?
    - Finding the largest item in the array before the last p items.
INS-QA
 - How many passes to sort n elements?
    - n - 1
 - What do you know after pass p?
    - All of indexes 0 to p elements are sorted
 - How will you know when sorted?
    - When you've finished n - 1 passes
 - What constitues a pass?
    - Going through every adjacent pair from 0 to p
 - What must you track?
    - You must track p, and the current index within a pass
